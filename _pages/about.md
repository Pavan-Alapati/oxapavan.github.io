I’m *Pavan Alapati*, I am a rising third-year undergraduate Student at KL University, specializing in computer Science ( Cyber Security ). My research centers on exploring Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Lateral Movement & Many offencive security Mechanism's.

As a student, I've been fortunate to receive guidance and support from many people along my journey, and it’s made a huge difference. Now, I’m always happy for helping others and sharing what I’ve learned from my experiences. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you ever need advice or assistance!

On my blog, I'll post CTF writeups, my CVE findings, and whatever else comes to mind.
